# 🤖 Robo Path Finding Game

An interactive Python GUI game built with Tkinter that demonstrates classic pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS in a fun, visual way.

The player places a robot (start) and a flag (goal), draws walls to create obstacles, and selects an algorithm to find the shortest path.
